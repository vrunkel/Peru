Simple application to manage scientific literature 

As a long time user of Papers i couldn't find my way around in the latest version 4. I decided to do my own application and learning SwiftUI better that way. Currently it is not finished yet. Focus lies on the general UI and import of Endnote XML files. As soon as this works, manual addition, copy&paste and maybe the match tool will be added. And of course the usage of collections.

The UI is rather straight forward. It is based on a table showing the literature (articles, books, ...) available in the database. Left side bar allows direrct selection of keywords (if available) and the creation and use of collections. A collection for example is useful if you want to group literature cited in a work you publish. On the right is a display of article/book details as shown in the screenshot.

If the edit mode is activated entries for the article (single selection only) can be edited.
