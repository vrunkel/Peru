Simple application to manage scientific literature 

As a long time user of Papers i couldn't find my way around in the latest version 4. I decided to do my own application and learnign SwiftUI better that way. Currently it is not finished yet. Focus lies on the general UI and import of Endnote XML files. As soon as thsi works, manual addition, copy&paste and maybe the match tool will be added. And of course the usage of collections.
